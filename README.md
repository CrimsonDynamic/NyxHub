# NyxHub — Personal Website

This is my personal website hosted at [nyx.dog](https://nyx.dog), built on top of the [Astrogon](https://github.com/astrogon/astrogon) template by [Reed Nelson](https://github.com/reednel).  
I'm customizing it to reflect my creative and technical work.

## What You'll Find Here

NyxHub is my digital home — a central space for:

- **Blog posts**: thoughts, reflections, maybe a bit of chaos
- **Stories**: fiction, worldbuilding, and narrative experiments
- **Wiki**: my custom-built universes and scattered lore
- **Code projects**: things I make for fun, curiosity, or caffeine

---

## Customizations So Far

- Adjusted site structure for multiple content types
- Tweaked theme and styling for a darker, more personal vibe
- Added custom sections for wiki and storytelling
- Integrated GitHub and external project links

(More to come — it's evolving.)
