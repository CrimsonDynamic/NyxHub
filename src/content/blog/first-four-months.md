A review of the last months

## Start in a new Year

The year started with a bang and quite a good one. Spending New Years Eve with new friends I made in Uni was great in comparison to last years New Years Eve where I was in Kaunas with people I'm not sure I was friends with. But thats not even the best part that happened in January. 

### January and February
Out of curiosity or boredom, I do not know, I opened Tinder and swiped with a boy I did find cute when I met him first in the semester opening day in september and a couple hours later, we matched. It did not take long for us to notice how similar our hobbies were and that we take an interest in the same things.
We continued writing and calling each day the rest of the week and we made plans to watch Wicked together in the cinema. The day comes, a saturday, and we meet each other at the train station and the first thought I had was how cute he looks. We also chose the couple seat as a joke, basically a couch u can lay on and cuddle which we inevitably did. Halfway in the movie we started holding hands and I think I gave him a kiss. 

After the movie we went to a local bar I know and stayed there for 3-4 more hours and made out and drank cocktails and by tthe end of the day he said I can take out single from my bio. To be honest I was very surprised but also happy. I thought about saying we should slow down and not rush things but I thought fuck it we ball and just went with it. Everyday after that we basically spent on call and played games and be lovey dovey and I loved it. It was my first relationship and I was definitely on a high. We also meet on a Tuesday in uni since we still had classes and made out in empty classrooms and in the social room of the student council while watching a series we started together. 

On the following weekend he came to visit me at my apartment after he was on a birthday party and stayed over the night. I was honestly over the moon and I still miss cuddling in bed. It's the thing I miss most I think. In the morning I got us breakfast from the bakery and we chilled in bed cuddling and watching series and I never wanted it to stop.

The following weeks all went similar, we went on dates and he slept over at my place and once I visited him at his place.

It all came to a sudden end on February 3rd where he broke up with me via discord and to be honest I can understand his decision and I felt similar in some way but it still hurt a lot. The most confusing thing for me was that we still did all the things we did as a couple still while being broken up which messed me up because mentally I was still thinking we were kinda in a relationship while we were not. He slowly got more distant over time treating me like a normal friend which hurt me even more since I was still in that previously mentioned mindset. 

### March
March I was starting to heal from it and I asked after we went bouldering if he ever could see something romantic with me again and he said no. After that I was a sobbing mess on train with him. I'm sorry he had to see me like that. I did become a bit more distant myself to protect and heal myself slowly and it started bearing fruits. By the end of march I felt way better and wasnt thinkg about him as much as I used to. Otherwise march was very boring and nothing really happened.

### April
In the beginning of april I thought myself free of thought of him, I was finally over it and started being on dating apps etc. but I noticed I was way over my head and need to go things slowly which hurt a person I liked, who I met online. Im starting to get better and feel more alive, uni also started so that helps  not just being in my room and just being sad and moody. I still think of him occassionally but more as a friend than a love interest. The saddest thing though is right before he broke up with me I felt for the first time that I could say I love you to someone and genuinely mean it. 

> What was meant to be would be there's no time to mourn the things that could be.
